    <h1>Introduction to Web Development Summer Camp</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>In our interconnected and rapidly advancing world,
      digital literacy is an essential skill for everyone, regardless of their field of study or 
        career aspirations.
        Recognizing this need, we at the C3 Club have designed an accessible and 
        comprehensive course titled "Introduction to Web Development." This program is 
        open to all students, regardless of their majors, and is prepared to provide a unique 
        blend of theoretical understanding and hands-on experience in the exciting world of 
        web development.</p>
    
    <h3>Our Goal</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Our primary goal is to enable students from diverse disciplines to gain valuable skills 
        and broaden their horizons. For Computer Science and Technology (CST/MCST) and 
        Electronic Information Engineering (EIE) or Information and Communication 
        Engineering (ICE) students, this course is prepared to provide a solid foundation in 
        coding and programming, essential to their respective fields. For students pursuing 
        Business Administration (BBA) and Master of Business Administration (MBA), the 
        course will offer insight into website design and a glimpse into the future of digital 
        business.</p>
