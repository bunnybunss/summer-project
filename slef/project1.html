    <h2>Chamomilla tea </h2>
    <p>A member of the Asteraceae family, chamomile is closely related to echinacea, sunflowers, marigolds, and other daisy-like flowers. 
       The name comes from the Greek word chamaimēlon, meaning "ground apple." The flowering herb has been used as a medicinal tonic and topical remedy for thousands of years.
       1 Though its use likely predates the period, it is known to have been drunk by Ancient Egyptians. Chamomile was also used as both a beverage and incense by the Romans.
       There are two main types of chamomile: Anthemis nobilis (Roman chamomile) and Matricaria chamomilla (German or wild chamomile).
       The Roman variety was named by a botanist in the 19th century who found it growing near the Colosseum in Rome.
       German chamomile tends to have a more robust, almost pungent scent, while Roman chamomile is sweeter and fruitier.
       The chamomile plant's flowers and buds are harvested for tea as the flowers open. It continually blooms for a few months,
       depending on the climate in which it's grown. 
       Egypt and Eastern Europe lead chamomile cultivation, though it's grown worldwide, and German chamomile often grows wild.
       After harvest, the flowers are dried to prolong the shelf life. When this occurs, 
       the white petals turn a pale yellow and may fall off the yellow head, which is its most recognizable form.</p>

    <h2>the benifits of Chamomilla tea </h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li> Menstrual symptoms
         In 2019, some researchersTrusted Source concluded that chamomile’s anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, sedative,
             and anti-anxiety properties might help relieve anxiety and discomfort due to premenstrual syndrome (PMS).</li>
         <li>Diabetes and blood sugar
          Some studies have found that chamomile tea can lower blood sugar in people with diabetes.
          ResearchTrusted Source suggests that chamomile might improve glycemic and lipid profiles and oxidative stress levels 
          in people with diabetes mellitus and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications.
          The results do not show that chamomile is a viable substitute for diabetes medications, 
          but it may be a helpful supplement to existing treatments.</li>
         <li>Cancer
        Some studies suggest that chamomile tea may target cancer cells or even prevent those cells 
          from developing in the first place.
          Results from laboratory tests have suggested that compounds in chamomile may help prevent the growth of glioma, 
          liver cancer, cervical cancer, and leukemia.
          However, more research is needed to prove chamomile's anticancer claims.</li>
         <li>Cold symptoms
          Anecdotal evidence and some studiesTrusted Source suggest that inhaling steam with chamomile extract 
          can relieve some of the symptoms of the common cold. However, this benefit is not proven yet.</li>
